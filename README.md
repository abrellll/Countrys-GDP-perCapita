# Analysis and Prediction The Value of GDP PerCapita in Each Country
Gross domestic product (GDP) is a standardized measure of the value added created through the production of goods and services produced within a country's borders in a given period of time. As a broad measure of overall domestic production, it serves as a comprehensive scorecard of a country's economic health. In this Final Project, we will investigate the "Countries of the World" dataset by Fernando Lasso that we got from Kaggle. We will focus on the factors that affect a country's GDP per capita and try to build a model using the data of 227 countries from the dataset. We will also briefly discuss total GDP.

The analysis approach in this study used the Linear Regression algorithm. The Linear Regression algorithm is a way of measuring prediction data through a straight line as a description of the correlation relationship between 2 or more variables. Linear regression prediction is used as a technique to study how variables relate to the data forecasting process. Linear regression analysis is based on six fundamental assumptions. The dependent and independent variables show a linear relationship between the slope and intercept. The independent variables are not random. The residual (error) value is zero. The residual (error) value is constant across all observations. Residual values (errors) are uncorrelated across all observations. Residual (error) values follow a normal distribution.
